# Matrix Inverse (CUDA Notes)

## Concept

Calculating the inverse of a matrix is a fundamental linear algebra operation. CUDA can accelerate this operation, especially for large matrices.

## Mathematical Formulation

Given a square matrix $A$, its inverse $A^{-1}$ satisfies:

$$
A \cdot A^{-1} = A^{-1} \cdot A = I
$$

Where $I$ is the identity matrix.

## CUDA Implementation

### Key Considerations

* **Computational Complexity:** Matrix inversion is computationally expensive (O(n^3)).
* **Numerical Stability:** Floating-point precision can affect accuracy.
* **Libraries:** Libraries like cuSOLVER provide optimized routines.
