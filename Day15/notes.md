# Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication 

## 1. Introduction to Sparse Matrices  
A **sparse matrix** is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Sparse matrices arise naturally in many real-world applications such as scientific computing, machine learning, and graph-based problems.

Instead of storing all elements (including zeros), we can represent this matrix more efficiently using the **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)** format.

## 2. Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Format  
**CSR** is a commonly used format for storing sparse matrices to save space and speed up operations like matrix-vector multiplication. It consists of three arrays:  

- **`values[]`**: Non-zero elements of the matrix.  
- **`colIdx[]`**: Column indices corresponding to each non-zero value.  
- **`rowPtr[]`**: Array that marks the starting position of each row in the `values[]` array.

## 3. Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV)  
**SpMV** is an operation where a sparse matrix is multiplied by a dense vector. It is commonly used in computational problems where the matrix is too large to be processed using standard dense matrix representations.

### Kernel Steps:  
1. Each thread corresponds to a row in the matrix.  
2. For the given row, multiply each non-zero element with the corresponding element in the input vector.  
3. Sum the results for that row and store it in the output vector.

## 4. Applications of Sparse Matrices  

### A. Collaborative Filtering (Recommendation Systems)  
- **Collaborative filtering** is used in recommendation systems like **Netflix**, **Amazon**, and **Spotify**.  
- Sparse matrices represent user-item interactions. For example, a matrix where each entry represents a userâ€™s rating for a specific movie, but most entries are zero because not all users rate every movie.  

### B. Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- In **NLP**, sparse matrices are used to represent large text datasets. Each row corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds to a unique word.  
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a common representation, where most values are zero because only a few words appear in each document.

## 5. Advantages of Using CSR for SpMV  

- **Efficient Storage**: Reduces memory usage by only storing non-zero values.  
- **Faster Computation**: SpMV is faster using CSR compared to dense representations, especially on large matrices.  
- **Scalable on GPUs**: CSR can be parallelized efficiently with **CUDA** for real-time applications.

## 6. Applications Summary  

- **Machine Learning**: Collaborative filtering, graph neural networks, clustering.  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Document classification, topic modeling, text similarity.  
- **Scientific Computing**: Finite element analysis, network analysis, graph-based computations.  
- **Computer Vision**: Sparse convolution for certain types of image processing.
