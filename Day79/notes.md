# Residual Connections in CUDA C

## Introduction
Residual connections are a key concept in deep learning, especially in architectures like ResNet (Residual Networks). These connections allow the input to skip certain layers and be added directly to the output of a layer, helping to prevent issues like vanishing gradients during training. Implementing residual connections in CUDA C involves using memory and kernel management efficiently.

## Key Concepts of Residual Connections

- **Skip Connections**: These are connections that skip one or more layers in the neural network. In the context of residual connections, the input is directly added to the output of the block.
- **Identity Mapping**: The idea of passing the input through the network without any transformation, and adding it back to the output of the transformation (like convolutions).
- **Gradient Flow**: Residual connections help gradients flow more effectively during backpropagation, especially in deep networks.

## CUDA C Code for Implementing Residual Connection

Below is a basic CUDA C example to illustrate how a residual connection can be implemented for a simple operation (e.g., matrix addition) on the GPU. This demonstrates how you might create a residual connection in a neural network layer operation.
