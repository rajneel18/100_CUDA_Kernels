# Optimized Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) (CUDA Notes)

## Optimizations

Optimizing Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) in CUDA primarily focuses on numerical stability and efficiency.

### Numerical Stability

* **Log-Sum-Exp Trick:** Avoid direct computation of `log(1 - p)` by using:

    ```
    log(1 - p) = log(exp(-log(p))) = -log(p)
    ```

    when `p` is close to 1. This prevents potential underflow.

* **Clipping and Epsilon:** Clip predicted probabilities to a small range (e.g., `epsilon` to `1 - epsilon`) to avoid `log(0)` or `log(1)`.

### Efficiency

* **Fused Kernel:** Combine the loss and gradient calculations into a single kernel to reduce memory access.
* **Shared Memory:** Utilize shared memory for intermediate calculations, if possible, especially during reduction.
* **Reduction Optimization:** Efficiently implement the summation (reduction) operation.
* **Avoid Redundant Calculations:** Pre-calculate values that are used multiple times within the kernel.
