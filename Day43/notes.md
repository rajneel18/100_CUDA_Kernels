# GeGLU (Gated GELU) (CUDA Notes)

## Concept

GeGLU is an activation function that combines the GELU activation with a gated linear unit. It is similar to SwiGLU but uses GELU instead of Swish.

## Mathematical Formulation

GeGLU is defined as:

$$
GeGLU(x, W, V) = GELU(xW) \otimes (xV)
$$

Where:

* $x$ is the input tensor.
* $W$ and $V$ are weight matrices.
* $GELU(x) = x \cdot \Phi(x)$, where $\Phi(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
* $\otimes$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

## CUDA Implementation

### Key Considerations

* **Matrix Multiplication:** The computation involves matrix multiplications ($xW$ and $xV$), which can be efficiently performed using cuBLAS.
* **GELU Activation:** The GELU activation is applied element-wise.
* **Element-wise Multiplication:** The final step is an element-wise multiplication.
