# HyperNetworks in CUDA 

## Overview
HyperNetworks generate the weights of another neural network dynamically instead of storing them explicitly. This approach reduces memory requirements and enables adaptive learning.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define the HyperNetwork**: A small neural network that generates weights for the main network.
2. **Use CUDA Kernels**: Implement matrix multiplications and activations using CUDA.
3. **Train the HyperNetwork**: Optimize to generate useful weights for the target network.
4. **Evaluate Efficiency**: Compare memory consumption and performance with standard deep learning models.
