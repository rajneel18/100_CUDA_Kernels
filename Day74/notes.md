# PCA using CUDA - Covariance Matrix Computation

## Objective
Implement the **first step of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** â€” calculating the **covariance matrix** in parallel using CUDA C.

## Theory

### What is PCA?
Principal Component Analysis is a technique used for:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Feature extraction
- Noise reduction

It does this by projecting data onto a new basis formed by the **eigenvectors** of the covariance matrix of the data.
