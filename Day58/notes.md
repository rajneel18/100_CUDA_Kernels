# L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) in CUDA Notes

## Concept

L-BFGS is a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm that approximates the Hessian matrix using a limited amount of memory. It's suitable for large-scale problems where computing the full Hessian is infeasible.

## Key Concepts

* **Quasi-Newton Method:** Approximates the Hessian using gradient information.
* **Limited Memory:** Stores only a few vector pairs (s, y) to approximate the Hessian.
* **Two-Loop Recursion:** Efficiently computes the Hessian-vector product.
* **Line Search:** Used to determine the step size.

## CUDA Implementation Considerations

* **Gradient Calculation:** The gradient computation is the most computationally intensive part and can be effectively parallelized using CUDA.
* **Vector Operations:** Vector operations (dot products, vector additions, scalar multiplications) can also be parallelized.
* **Two-Loop Recursion:** This part can be implemented on the GPU, but it might be less efficient due to its sequential nature.
* **Line Search:** The line search often involves function evaluations, which can be parallelized if the function is computationally expensive.
* **Memory Management:** Efficiently manage the limited memory used to store the (s, y) pairs.
* **Host-Device Interactions:** Minimizing data transfers between the host and device is crucial for performance.

## Algorithm Outline

1.  **Gradient Calculation:** Compute the gradient of the objective function.
2.  **Two-Loop Recursion:**
    * Compute the search direction using the stored (s, y) pairs.
    * This involves sequential operations, making it less ideal for full GPU parallelization.
3.  **Line Search:**
    * Determine the step size along the search direction.
    * Function evaluations can be parallelized if they are expensive.
4.  **Update (s, y) pairs:**
    * Store the new (s, y) pair, where:
        * `s = x_new - x_old`
        * `y = gradient_new - gradient_old`
    * Maintain the limited memory buffer.
5.  **Repeat:** Steps 1-4 until convergence.

## CUDA Implementation Notes

* **Gradient Kernel:**
    * Implement a CUDA kernel to compute the gradient.
    * Ensure coalesced memory access.
* **Vector Operation Kernels:**
    * Implement CUDA kernels for vector dot products, additions, and scalar multiplications.
    * Use shared memory for efficiency.
* **Two-Loop Recursion (Hybrid Approach):**
    * Consider a hybrid approach:
        * Compute the gradient and vector operations on the GPU.
        * Perform the two-loop recursion on the CPU (due to its sequential nature).
* **Line Search Kernel:**
    * If the function evaluation is computationally expensive, implement a CUDA kernel.
    * Parallelize the function evaluations if possible.
* **Memory Management:**
    * Allocate device memory for the (s, y) pairs.
    * Use circular buffers or other efficient data structures.
* **Data Transfer:**
    * Minimize host-device data transfers.
    * Transfer only necessary data.
* **cuBLAS:**
    * Use cuBLAS for linear algebra operations, if applicable.
