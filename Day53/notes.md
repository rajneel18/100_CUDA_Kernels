# Voronoi Diagram Computation (CUDA Notes)

## Concept

A Voronoi diagram partitions a plane into regions based on distance to a set of points (sites). Each region contains all points closer to its site than to any other site. CUDA can accelerate Voronoi diagram computation, especially for large datasets.

## Algorithm (Conceptual)

1.  **Distance Calculation:** For each pixel in the output image, calculate the distance to all sites.
2.  **Nearest Site Determination:** Find the site with the minimum distance for each pixel.
3.  **Region Assignment:** Assign the pixel to the region corresponding to the nearest site.
4.  **Coloring/Visualization:** Optionally, color the regions based on site indices or distances.

## CUDA Implementation

### Key Considerations

* **Parallelism:** Each pixel's region can be computed independently, making it highly parallelizable.
* **Distance Metric:** Euclidean distance is common, but other metrics can be used.
* **Memory Access:** Efficient memory access patterns are crucial for performance.
* **Large Datasets:** For very large site datasets or high-resolution images, tiling or block processing may be required.
