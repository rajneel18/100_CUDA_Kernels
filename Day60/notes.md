# CUDA-Based Symbolic Differentiation for Auto-Diff

## Overview
This approach implements a GPU-accelerated symbolic differentiation engine for scientific computing and deep learning using CUDA.

## Key Features
- Computes derivatives of polynomial expressions in parallel.
- Utilizes reverse-mode automatic differentiation.
- Optimized with shared memory and thread blocks for efficiency.

## CUDA Algorithm
1. Store polynomial terms: coefficients and exponents.
2. Execute a parallel kernel to compute derivatives 
3. Copy results back to the CPU and simplify the expressions.

## Future Enhancements
- Extend to multi-variable differentiation.
- Implement symbolic simplification.
- Support expression trees and non-polynomial functions.
