## Notes on Fast Hartley Transform (FHT) with CUDA

This document describes the theoretical concepts behind the provided CUDA code, which implements the Fast Hartley Transform (FHT).

### Core Concepts

*   **Fast Hartley Transform (FHT):**  A transform similar to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), but which operates on real numbers, producing a real output.  It's closely related to the DFT and can be more efficient for real-valued signals. The FHT decomposes a signal into a sum of cosine and sine waves of different frequencies.
*   **Discrete Transforms:** Mathematical operations that convert a discrete-time signal from the time domain to the frequency domain (or a related domain).  The FHT and DFT are examples.
*   **Frequency Domain:**  Represents a signal in terms of its constituent frequencies.  The FHT output represents the amplitudes of the different frequency components present in the input signal.
*   **Real-valued Signal:** A signal whose values are real numbers. This is in contrast to complex-valued signals.  The FHT is particularly efficient for real-valued signals.

### CUDA Implementation Details

*   **Kernel:** The `FHT_kernel` function is a CUDA kernel, executed on the GPU by multiple threads. It calculates the FHT coefficients in parallel.
*   **Threads, Blocks, and Grids:** The kernel is launched with a specific number of blocks and threads per block. Each thread computes a portion of the FHT.
*   **Global Memory:** The input and output arrays reside in global memory on the GPU, accessible by all threads.
*   **Parallel Computation:** Each thread in the kernel calculates one FHT coefficient. The loop within the kernel iterates over the input signal, performing the necessary computations for a single output coefficient.
*   **Data Transfer:**  `cudaMemcpy` is used to transfer the input signal from the host (CPU) to the device (GPU) memory before kernel execution, and the results are copied back to the host after the kernel completes.
*   **Block Size and Number of Blocks:** These parameters determine how the work is divided among the GPU's processing units.  Choosing appropriate values is important for performance.

### Mathematical Formulation (Simplified)

The FHT can be represented mathematically.  For a real-valued input signal *x[n]* of length *N*, the FHT output *H[k]* is given by:
