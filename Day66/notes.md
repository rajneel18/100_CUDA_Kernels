## Overview
This CUDA implementation performs LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) matrix multiplication in parallel. LoRA is a technique for efficiently adapting large-scale models by decomposing weight updates into low-rank matrices, reducing memory consumption and computational cost.

## Key Features
- **Parallelized Matrix Computation:** Utilizes CUDA to compute matrix multiplications efficiently.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Achieves significant speed-up over CPU-based matrix operations.
- **Error Analysis:** Compares GPU and CPU outputs to validate correctness.


## Conclusion
- LoRA matrix multiplication can be highly **optimized on CUDA**, achieving substantial performance improvements over CPU execution.
- The **numerical difference between GPU and CPU** results is minimal, ensuring correctness.
- This implementation can be **scaled further** for larger datasets and real-world applications in deep learning.


**Next Steps:**
- Optimize memory access patterns (e.g., shared memory usage).
- Experiment with different matrix sizes and rank values for LoRA adaptation.
- Implement LoRA in real-world deep learning inference workloads.
