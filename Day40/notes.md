# RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings) in CUDA (Markdown Notes)

## Concept

Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) are a technique used in transformer models to encode positional information. They apply a rotation matrix based on the position of each token.

## Mathematical Formulation

Given a query or key vector `q` (or `k`) and a position `pos`, the RoPE applies a rotation:

q_rotated = R(pos) * q


Where:

* `R(pos)` is a rotation matrix determined by the position `pos`.
* `R(pos)` is defined as:

R(pos){2i, 2i} = cos(pos * theta_i)
R(pos){2i, 2i+1} = -sin(pos * theta_i)
R(pos){2i+1, 2i} = sin(pos * theta_i)
R(pos){2i+1, 2i+1} = cos(pos * theta_i)


* `theta_i = 10000^(-2i / d)` where `d` is the dimension of the embeddings.

## CUDA Implementation

### Key Considerations

* **Element-wise Rotation:** The rotation is applied element-wise to each pair of elements in the query or key vector.
* **Precomputed Rotations:** Precompute `sin(pos * theta_i)` and `cos(pos * theta_i)` values for efficiency.
* **Memory Access:** Ensure coalesced memory access for optimal performance.
