# CUDA FFT Audio Processing (Notes)

## Concept

Using CUDA and cuFFT to accelerate Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations for audio processing.

## Benefits

* **Parallelism:** GPUs excel at parallel computations, significantly speeding up FFT calculations.
* **Real-time Processing:** Enables real-time audio analysis and manipulation.
* **Large Datasets:** Efficiently handles large audio buffers.

## cuFFT Library

* NVIDIA's cuFFT library provides optimized FFT implementations for CUDA.
* Supports various FFT types (real-to-complex, complex-to-complex, etc.).
* Handles different data layouts and batch processing.

## CUDA Implementation Steps

1.  **Allocate Device Memory:**
    * Allocate GPU memory for input audio data and FFT output.
2.  **Copy Audio Data to Device:**
    * Transfer audio data from host (CPU) to device (GPU).
3.  **Create cuFFT Plan:**
    * Configure the FFT plan (FFT size, data type, batch size).
    * `cufftPlan1d()`, `cufftPlanMany()`, etc.
4.  **Execute FFT:**
    * Call `cufftExecR2C()` (real-to-complex), `cufftExecC2C()` (complex-to-complex), etc.
5.  **Copy FFT Output to Host (Optional):**
    * Transfer FFT results from device to host for further processing.
6.  **Process FFT Data:**
    * Perform audio analysis/manipulation in the frequency domain.
7.  **Inverse FFT (Optional):**
    * Perform inverse FFT to convert back to the time domain.
8.  **Cleanup:**
    * Destroy the cuFFT plan and free allocated memory.
