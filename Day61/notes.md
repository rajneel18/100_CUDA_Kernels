# Evolutionary Algorithm in CUDA

## Overview
Evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by natural selection. They use mechanisms such as mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve solutions over multiple generations.

## CUDA Acceleration
- **Parallel Population Evaluation**: Fitness computation for all individuals is performed in parallel.
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses `curand` for stochastic variation (mutation, crossover).
- **Efficient Selection and Mutation**: Uses GPU threads for parallelized genetic operations.

## Key Components
- **Chromosome Representation**: Encodes potential solutions.
- **Fitness Function**: Evaluates the quality of a solution.
- **Selection**: Picks the best candidates for reproduction.
- **Crossover & Mutation**: Creates new candidate solutions.

## Applications
- Hyperparameter tuning in deep learning.
- Solving NP-hard optimization problems.
- Robotics and control system optimization.

## CUDA Benefits
- **Massively parallel execution**: Handles large populations efficiently.
- **Faster fitness evaluations**: Reduces training time significantly.
- **Better scalability**: Leverages thousands of CUDA cores.
