# Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) in CUDA

## Overview
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are a type of unsupervised neural network used for clustering and dimensionality reduction by mapping high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional grid.

## CUDA Acceleration
- **Parallel Distance Computation**: Each input vector is compared to all neurons in parallel.
- **Efficient Weight Updates**: GPU threads update neuron weights in parallel.
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple data points can be processed simultaneously.

## Key Components
- **Neurons (Codebook Vectors)**: Represent clusters in reduced-dimensional space.
- **Best Matching Unit (BMU)**: The closest neuron to an input vector.
- **Neighborhood Function**: Determines how weights of nearby neurons are updated.
- **Learning Rate Decay**: Adjusts learning over iterations.

## Applications
- Feature visualization in high-dimensional datasets.
- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity and finance.
- Image and speech data clustering.

## CUDA Benefits
- **Massively parallel distance calculations**: Speeding up BMU searches.
- **Faster weight updates**: Each thread updates a neuron's weight in parallel.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently.
