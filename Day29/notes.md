## CUDA K-Means Clustering (Short Notes)

**Concept:** Implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm efficiently on GPUs using CUDA.

**K-Means Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** Randomly select K cluster centroids.
2.  **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3.  **Update:** Recalculate the centroids as the mean of the assigned data points.
4.  **Repeat:** Steps 2 and 3 until convergence.

**CUDA K-Means Implementation:**

1.  **Distance Calculation (Assignment Step):**
    * Calculate the distance between each data point and each centroid.
    * CUDA: Element-wise kernel to calculate distances (e.g., Euclidean distance).
    * Store the index of the nearest centroid for each data point.
2.  **Centroid Update:**
    * Calculate the mean of the data points assigned to each centroid.
    * CUDA: Reduction kernel to sum the data points assigned to each centroid, followed by a division to calculate the mean.
    * Uses atomic operations to avoid race conditions when accumulating the sum.
3.  **Convergence Check:**
    * Check if the centroids have changed significantly since the last iteration.
    * CUDA: Reduction kernel to calculate the maximum change in centroid positions.
    * If the change is below a threshold, the algorithm has converged.
