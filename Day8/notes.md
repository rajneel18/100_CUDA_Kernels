# Tiling for Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is an essential operation in various scientific and engineering computations. The naive algorithm for matrix multiplication has a time complexity of \( O(n^3) \), but optimizing this operation is crucial for performance, especially when dealing with large matrices. One of the most effective optimization techniques is **tiling**, which divides the matrix into smaller submatrices, or tiles, and computes them in blocks to exploit memory locality and parallelism.

Tiling (also known as blocking is a technique used to break a large matrix into smaller submatrices called tiles. The purpose is to optimize memory access and improve cache utilization by operating on small blocks that fit into the CPU cache or the shared memory of a GPU.


## Tiling in Matrix Multiplication

When multiplying two matrices \( A \) and \( B \), the naive approach computes the resulting matrix \( C \) using a triple nested loop:

This can lead to inefficient memory access patterns, especially when the matrices are large and do not fit into cache. The idea behind tiling is to divide each matrix into smaller blocks (tiles) and perform the matrix multiplication on these smaller blocks.

### Benefits of Tiling

1. **Improved Cache Efficiency**: By working on smaller submatrices that fit into cache, the algorithm can reduce cache misses.
2. **Reduced Memory Traffic**: It reduces the number of times data needs to be fetched from main memory or global memory (in the case of GPU).
3. **Parallelism**: Tiling enables parallel execution on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs because the smaller tiles can be computed independently in parallel.

### Tiling Algorithm

Consider the matrices \( A \) of size \( n \times n \), \( B \) of size \( n \times n \), and \( C \) of size \( n \times n \). The basic idea is to partition each matrix into smaller \( b \times b \) submatrices (tiles), where \( b \) is the tile size, and perform the multiplication on these submatrices.

The algorithm 

1. **Partition the matrices**: Divide each matrix into \( \frac{n}{b} \times \frac{n}{b} \) blocks.
2. **Block multiplication**: For each block, multiply the corresponding tiles from \( A \) and \( B \), and accumulate the results in the corresponding tile of \( C \).




Tiling is a powerful optimization technique for matrix multiplication, especially in high-performance computing. By partitioning matrices into smaller blocks, tiling improves memory usage, reduces cache misses, and allows for parallel computation. When implemented effectively on modern hardware, such as GPUs, tiling can significantly improve the performance of matrix multiplication, making it a key technique in numerical and scientific computations.
