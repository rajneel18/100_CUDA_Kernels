## CUDA Memory Analysis

### **Global Memory (First 5):** `10 11 12 13 14`

#### **What’s happening?**
- Each thread reads from **global memory**, which is slow but accessible to all threads.
- The values are sequential (`x, x+1, x+2, ...`), meaning **each thread reads a unique index** from a globally allocated array.

#### **Conclusion:**
```cpp
globalMem[threadIdx.x] = baseValue + threadIdx.x;
```
- The kernel probably initializes **global memory as an array**.

### **Shared Memory (First 5):** `20 22 24 26 28`

#### **What’s happening?**
- Each **block** has its own **shared memory**, and within a block, threads **collaborate**.
- The numbers increase with a step of `2`, meaning **each thread might be computing based on thread ID**.

#### **Conclusion:**
```cpp
sharedMem[threadIdx.x] = 20 + threadIdx.x * 2;
```
- Since **shared memory is block-local**, threads within the same block share this data.

---

### **Constant Memory (First 5):** `40 44 48 52 56`

#### **What’s happening?**
- All threads read from **constant memory**, which is **read-only and optimized for broadcasting**.
- The numbers follow a fixed pattern with a step of `4`, suggesting that a **predefined array in constant memory** exists.

#### **Conclusion:**
```cpp
__constant__ int constMem[SIZE];
```
- Threads read from this array with `constMem[threadIdx.x]` where values were initialized like `40, 44, 48...`.

---

### **Texture Memory (First 5):** `0 1 2 3 4`

#### **What’s happening?**
- **Texture memory is cached** and optimized for **2D spatial locality**.
- The numbers follow a simple sequential pattern, indicating **a texture fetch operation**.

#### **Conclusion:**
```cpp
tex1Dfetch(textureRef, threadIdx.x);
```
- The kernel probably **binds an array to texture memory** and reads it via `tex1Dfetch(textureRef, threadIdx.x)`.
- This shows how texture memory **retrieves values efficiently** in certain access patterns.

---

### **Register Memory (First 5):** `0 2 4 6 8`

#### **What’s happening?**
- **Registers are private per thread**, meaning each thread has its own independent set.
- The numbers are increasing by `2`, suggesting **thread-dependent calculations**.

#### **Conclusion:**
```cpp
int regVal = threadIdx.x * 2;
```
- Since **registers are the fastest**, this computation happens almost instantly per thread.

---

### **Summary**
- **Global Memory**: Threads access an **array stored in global memory** *(slowest)*.
- **Shared Memory**: Each **block** has its own local shared memory *(faster than global)*.
- **Constant Memory**: Preloaded values **broadcasted efficiently** *(optimized for reads)*.
- **Texture Memory**: Accessing **cached texture data** *(useful for graphics or spatial data)*.
- **Register Memory**: **Per-thread computation** without memory access *(fastest)*.
