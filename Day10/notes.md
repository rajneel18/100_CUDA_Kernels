# 1D Parallel Convolution - Basic Concept

## Introduction
- Convolution is a process used in computing where an output is created by mixing an input with a small set of values called a mask.
- It is widely used in image processing, signal processing, and deep learning.

## Key Components
- **Input Array (N)**: The main data that needs to be processed.
- **Mask (M)**: A small set of values used to modify the input.
- **Output Array (P)**: The result after applying the mask to the input.
- **Mask Width**: The size of the mask, usually an odd number.
- **Data Width**: The total number of elements in the input and output.

## Parallel Processing
- Convolution is ideal for parallel computing because multiple output values can be computed at the same time.
- Each output value is calculated independently by combining the nearby input values using the mask.

## Handling Edges
- The beginning and end of the input may not have enough values to match the mask.
- These missing values are replaced with zeros or skipped.

## Challenges
- **Control Flow Divergence**: Different calculations happen at the edges, making processing uneven.
- **Memory Usage**: The process requires frequent access to memory, which can slow down performance.

## Optimization Ideas
- Reduce memory use by reusing values instead of fetching them repeatedly.
- Use shared memory to speed up access times.
- Process large data in small chunks to manage resources better.
