# Attention Linear Biases in CUDA C

## Introduction

In attention mechanisms like those used in Transformer models, the Query (`Q`), Key (`K`), and Value (`V`) matrices are typically passed through linear transformations before computing the attention scores. These transformations often include biases, which are added to the output of the matrix multiplication.

The addition of biases allows the model to have more flexibility and improve its ability to fit data. In CUDA C, biases can be incorporated efficiently into the attention computation, specifically in the linear transformations of the Query, Key, and Value matrices. This operation is crucial for the proper function of attention layers in deep learning models.

## Key Concepts

- **Linear Transformation with Bias**: 
  A typical linear transformation for `Q`, `K`, or `V` is represented as:
  \[
  Z = XW + b
  \]
  Where `X` is the input matrix (`Q`, `K`, or `V`), `W` is the weight matrix, and `b` is the bias vector. The operation `Z = XW + b` applies the linear transformation with bias.
  
- **Biases in Attention**:
  The Query, Key, and Value matrices are transformed using learned weight matrices and biases. Adding a bias allows the network to shift the outputs before the attention scores are computed, making it more expressive.

## CUDA C Code for Attention Linear Biases

The following CUDA C code demonstrates how to include biases in the linear transformations of `Q`, `K`, and `V` during the attention computation.
