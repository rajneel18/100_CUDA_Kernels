# Adhessian in CUDA (Notes)

## Concept

Adhessian (Adaptive Hessian) is an optimization algorithm that uses an adaptive approximation of the Hessian matrix to accelerate convergence. Implementing it in CUDA can leverage the GPU's parallel processing capabilities for efficient computation.

## Mathematical Formulation

Adhessian approximates the Hessian using a diagonal matrix and updates it adaptively based on the gradient and parameter changes. The update rule for the parameters is:

$$
x_{t+1} = x_t - H_t^{-1} g_t
$$

Where:

* $x_t$ is the parameter vector at iteration $t$.
* $g_t$ is the gradient of the objective function at $x_t$.
* $H_t$ is the adaptive Hessian approximation at iteration $t$.

The adaptive Hessian is typically a diagonal matrix, and its elements are updated as:

$$
H_{t+1, ii} = \beta H_{t, ii} + (1 - \beta) g_{t, i}^2
$$

Where:

* $\beta$ is a smoothing factor.

## CUDA Implementation

### Key Considerations

* **Element-wise Operations:** The Hessian and parameter updates are primarily element-wise, making them suitable for CUDA.
* **Gradient Computation:** The gradient calculation can be parallelized.
* **Inverse Hessian:** Since the Hessian is diagonal, its inverse is simply the reciprocal of its diagonal elements.
* **Memory Access:** Efficient memory access is crucial for performance.
