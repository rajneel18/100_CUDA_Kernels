# CUDA Ray Tracer 


## Concept

A CUDA ray tracer leverages the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to render 3D scenes by simulating the path of light rays.

## Key Concepts

* **Ray Generation:**
    * Generate rays from the camera's eye through each pixel of the image plane.
    * CUDA: Each thread generates a ray for a specific pixel.
* **Ray-Scene Intersection:**
    * Determine the intersection of each ray with objects in the scene.
    * CUDA: Each thread performs intersection tests for its ray against all objects.
* **Shading:**
    * Calculate the color of the intersection point based on lighting and material properties.
    * CUDA: Each thread performs shading calculations for its intersection point.
* **Acceleration Structures:**
    * Use data structures (e.g., BVH, KD-tree) to accelerate ray-scene intersection tests.
    * CUDA: These structures must be GPU-friendly and traversable in parallel.
* **Global Illumination:**
    * Simulate complex lighting effects (e.g., reflections, refractions, shadows).
    * CUDA: Requires recursive ray tracing or other advanced techniques.
